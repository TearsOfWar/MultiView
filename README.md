site is currently centered around https://ppv.to/ - and grabbing embedded links like https://embednow.top/embed/nfl/2864/2864-atl for example.

1. once you add all embedded stream links ( will work to add more link functionalities in the future to not be restricted to just ppv.tvo embedded links)
2. Click load streams - then you have to manually click the play button for each stream added (add block like bitdefener may or may not block the embedded links just depends)
3. once you have all the streams up you want to view then click hide controls twice - and the stream links section will disappear then select your layout depending on the number of streams up - if 4 select 2x2 and it will show a 2x2 stacked box for all 4 games full screen
4. to bring back the stream links section to change the current boxes click show controls but to put it back to full box click show controls twice.

HOW TO GET EMBEDDED LINKS 
1. Head to https://ppv.to/
